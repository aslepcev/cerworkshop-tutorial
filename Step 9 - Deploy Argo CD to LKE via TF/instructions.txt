Now things get a bit more complicated. 
We will use Terraform provider for Helm and Kubernetes to deploy ArgoCD on the LKE cluster we created earlier. 

Copy over the helm.tf to your terraform folder. 
In this file we are defining our Helm deployment for ArgoCD. 

Next we need to copy over the locals.tf and update our provider.tf file with additional providers. 

1. terraform plan
2. terraform apply
