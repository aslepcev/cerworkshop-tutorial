Since we will not be using k3s, we need to copy the cloud-init yaml file which we will use to deploy our AI infrastructure. 
Copy the ai.yaml file into the "yaml" folder we created earlier. 
Create a file called ai.tf and copy the contents of ai.tf in this folder to your ai.tf file. 
Run the following commands. 

1. terraform plan
2. terraform apply
