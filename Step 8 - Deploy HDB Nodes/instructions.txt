With our database, we are using a slightly different approach to using cloud-init.
We are templating some of the values which will be passed to the cloud-init file using terraform templating. 

1. Copy over the hdb.tpl file to the yaml folder 
2. Create a new file called database.tf and copy over the content of the database.tf file. 

Run the following commands. 

1. terraform plan
2. terraform apply
