Now that we have a VM and a LKE cluster running, let's start by deploying our API stack. 
Let's start by creating a new file called "api.tf" and copy the example for the k3s-api instance. 
Notice the difference in how we reference our regions. This will be very useful later!

Now we need to create a folder called "yaml" where we will keep all of our cloud-init yaml files. 

Copy the file "k3s.yaml" from this folder to the "yaml" folder in your root. 

Run the following commands. 

1. terraform plan
2. terraform apply
